This problem asks the user to find all combinations of U & L of lengths up to 30 that have at least 3 U's in a row.
If this is a competition setting then the correct answer is to test each combination which requires 2^N (350Brute.cpp). Of 
course this answer would time out, that's why you have the program run in the background and generate the output.
If you have time to think up an answer then you might come up with a solution in 580.cpp or 580.java, both
have the same implementation.
