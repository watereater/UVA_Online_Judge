This problem is a bit tricky. It says that for every word in a dictionary, all their definitions must also be words in the
dictionary. To make this simple, it means that the definitions be equal the words. To solve this you must do breath first search
on every word and find also possible connections by going from word to defintions and starting at those definitions. Once you 
finish the bfs you check is definitions == words in dictionary. At the end simply print out the possible solution. See code for
more clarity.
