This problems gives you a list of registers and the period of time it takes to return the result.
You are then given the amount of outputs you want from these registers. You can solve this problem
with a priority queue. You need to first compare the registers by their total time and then by
their ids. Each time you take out a register you increment the total time by the period of time it
takes to return the result.

For the java solution I included answers using both Comparable and Comparator. I also included a 
binary heap version so you can take a look at the internal workings of a priority queue.
